# LLM Control Plane

> An LLM control plane is the governance layer that intercepts every LLM-initiated tool call and ensures it's identified, authorized, safe, and auditable — before it reaches your backend services.

When a large language model calls your backend — through MCP, the OpenAI Apps SDK, or any tool-calling protocol — your backend receives a request but not the user's identity. The LLM forwarded the call with a shared API key. An LLM control plane solves this by sitting between LLM runtimes and your backend, enforcing six governance layers: identity verification, content safety, policy enforcement, rate limits, secure routing, and audit logging.
